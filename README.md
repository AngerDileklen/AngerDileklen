👋 Hello, I'm Anger!
Welcome to My GitHub Space 🌌
I'm Anger, an Economics student at McGill University with a passion for data analysis, visualization, and dynamic storytelling through numbers and trends. As a Data Analyst at Chimirec, I’m responsible for integrating Power BI models into server systems, automating data retrieval, and ensuring smooth, up-to-date reporting for impactful business decision-making.

My journey is a blend of economics, data science, engineering aspirations, and creative problem-solving. I have honed my skills in Power BI, financial modeling, and automation and am actively exploring opportunities to grow further in data-driven roles and engineering placements.

🎯 Areas of Interest and Skills:
Data Visualization & Analytics: Power BI, DAX, and other tools to turn data into clear, actionable insights.
Macroeconomics & Analysis: A deep understanding of macroeconomic models, policy impacts, and market behaviors.
Project Automation: Automating workflows and ensuring data integrity within corporate environments.
Programming: Python, SQL, and other languages for data manipulation and analysis.
Diverse Professional Interests: From Red Bull Technology Group’s engineering roles to Marsh McLennan’s client-facing positions and beyond.
🌟 What I’m Currently Up To:
Developing a seamless Power BI data integration system for my company's server.
Preparing for interviews with top firms like Marsh McLennan and Bell Canada to expand my skillset.
Engaging deeply with coursework in macroeconomics, civil society theories, and gender studies.
Reading Shakespearean works for inspiration—because there's always room for some poetry and drama! 🎭
⚡️ Fun Fact:
I love combining the rigor of economic analysis with creative storytelling! Whether through data visuals or critical discourse analysis on civil society theories, I enjoy bringing ideas to life in compelling ways.

Feel free to connect or check out my projects—I’m always excited to learn, collaborate, and grow!
